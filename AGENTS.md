# Repository Guidelines

## Shared Agent Practices
- Keep changes clean, modular, and professional. Prefer small, cohesive modules, clear naming, explicit boundaries, and tests over quick patches.
- When code behavior, public APIs, user workflows, operator workflows, or configuration semantics change, check whether `../xian-docs-web` needs corresponding documentation updates. If this repo is `xian-docs-web`, update the relevant published docs in place. Write durable user/developer documentation, not a changelog entry.
- For code changes, use graphify when available to check cross-repo impact before finishing: query the local `graphify-out/graph.json`, inspect paths with `graphify path` or `graphify explain`, and refresh with `graphify update .` after structural changes when useful.
- If graphify or dependency analysis shows affected sibling repos, update those repos in the same change when the impact is real and the fix is in scope.
- Treat `graphify-out/` as a generated local artifact. Do not commit it.
